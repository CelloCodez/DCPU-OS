# DCPU-OS
An OS for the DCPU-16.

I am working on porting it to v1.7 so it can use floppies to load programs and get rid of the current program system.

Best works in DCPU-Studio (http://badsector.github.io/dcpustud/), as it does NOT use the v1.7 specs as I like the old ones better (if only the old ones had floppies).

Credit do CubeOS for the idea for programs (https://github.com/cubeOS/cubeOS-alpha) (I took inspiration from their package system).
