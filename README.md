# DCPU-OS
An OS for the DCPU-16.

# New info (for main.dasm)

Now being worked on for the DCPU-16 v1.7, using the M35FD, LEM1802, and the Generic Keyboard as devices, and will use this emulator:

And this assembler:

# Old info (for os.dasm):

Best works in DCPU-Studio (http://badsector.github.io/dcpustud/), as it does NOT use the v1.7 specs as I like the old ones better (if only the old ones had floppies).

Credit do CubeOS for the idea for programs (https://github.com/cubeOS/cubeOS-alpha) (I took inspiration from their package system).
