Functions:

puts

Same as putc, but instead of register A being the
character, register A is the location in memory of
a zero-terminated string to print to the screen. It
will print all the letters, one after another. All
other registers (B,C,X) still apply as in putc.

putc

Puts a character, register A, to the screen at a video
memory offset of register C, with a color of register B
(0xF100 is default white text) and blinks the text if
register X is 1.
